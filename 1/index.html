      <h2>section one: Overview, My Approach, and Problems</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                <u>overview:<br /></u>
              
                The goal of this project was that, given digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images, to produce a single color RGB image.
                The input images were special because each input "image" file actually contained 3 images vertically stacked, each image representing
                one color channel. To essentially combine them into one and produce the single color RGB image, I had to align them in a way so that 
                the image would look as accurate as possible and minimize aliasing/artifacts.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <u>my approach:<br /></u>
              
                As the spec suggested, I split the large image into 3 and tried to align the G and R parts of the image to the B part of the image.
                To find the "best" alignment, I first relied on the L2 norm as the metric to use.
              </p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  My naive method included scoring with the L2 norm and, over a window of [-15, 15] displacements, would calculate the L2 norm between
                  the B and the other image in consideration, and use the displacement that produced the minimum deviation (smaller L2 score) to shift
                  the G and R images separately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My improved method relied on the pyramid alignment procedure. This involved first downsampling all the channels to have “smaller” images
                  that encoded less data (and thus were less detailed than the actual images). I'd start out with the naive method, finding the best displacement 
                  for this smaller image, which was relatively fast. Then I'd upscale the image by a factor of 2.0 at a time, keeping track of the "best displacement"
                  seen so far, and at every iteration also trying a small window of about [-6, 6] for other good displacements that may have been missed in the previous
                  downsampled step. I'd repeat until the image was the original size and use the best displacement found at the end.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After using the pyramid method, I wondered if I could make it look better with a different metric because the images still looked
                  a little bit off to me. So I used the NCC metric, but inversely (so larger scores were better), which did seem to improve image alignments.
                </li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>
                <u>some problems I encountered:</u>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  How to reason with row/column shifts. After some trial and error, I discovered <code>dx</code> referred to column shifts, which I later 
                  confirmed with use of a coordinate system, and then after that, intuition. Because columns must be moved side-to-side. So when I called the
                  <code>np.roll()</code> function, I had to make sure to feed in the parameter <code>shift=(dy, dx)</code> instead of the other way around.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Figuring out how to choose the right number of levels for the pyramid align method. For example, using too many levels may lose
                  too much information in the beginning.
                </li>
              </ol>
